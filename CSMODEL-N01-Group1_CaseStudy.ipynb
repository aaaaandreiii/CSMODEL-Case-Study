    "MCO1: Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "Zip file containing:\n",
    "<ul><li>Jupyter Notebook file – ipynb file</li>\n",
    "<li>Other Python 3 files – py files</li>\n",
    "<li>Dataset files – csv files</li>\n",
    "<li>Presentation file – pptx or canvas file</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifications\n",
    "You are tasked to go through the process of selecting a dataset, formulating research questions, analyzing data, modelling data, hypothesis testing, and extracting insights from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is to be submitted as a Jupyter Notebook and, optionally, some Python 3 source files. The notebook should be a self-explanatory document containing a report of the entire process undertaken to come up with the generated insights from the raw dataset. It should contain markup cells explaining the processes undertaken in the project, as well as code cells showing all the code that was performed. Please make sure that the codes could be successfully run sequentially to replicate the processes done in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1\n",
    "The first phase of the case study involves the four sections – (1) dataset description, (2) data cleaning, (3) Exploratory Data Analysis, and (4) research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "Each group should select their own real-world dataset to analyze. When selecting a dataset, please ensure that the dataset is collected properly. The dataset should contain enough variables to explore. As a rule of thumb, a good number would be at least 10 variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several online sources for public online datasets. Some of them are as follows:\n",
    "<ul><li>Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)</li>\n",
    "<li>Google Public Datasets (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/)</li>\n",
    "<li>Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org)</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets from other sources aside from the ones listed above may also be used. You may check a list of sample datasets at the last part of this document. Note that each group in a section should work on a different dataset. A sign-up sheet will be provided by your instructor to track all datasets reserved by all groups per section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the notebook, you must fulfill the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>State a brief description of the dataset.</li>\n",
    "<li>Provide a description of the collection process executed to build the dataset. Discuss the implications of the data collection method on the generated conclusions and insights. Note that you may need to look at relevant sources related to the dataset to be able to provide the necessary information for this part of the project.</li>\n",
    "<li>Describe the structure of the dataset file. In the dataset file, what does each row and column represent? How many observations are there in the dataset? How many variables are there in the dataset? If the dataset is composed of different files that you will combine in the succeeding steps, describe the structure and the contents of each file.</li>\n",
    "<li>Discuss the variables in each dataset file. What does each variable represent? In this section, all variables, even those which are not used for the study, should be described to the reader. The purpose of each variable in the dataset should be clear to the reader of the notebook without having to go through an external link.</ul></li>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "For each used variable, check for the following and, if needed, perform data cleaning:\n",
    "<ul><li>There are multiple representations of the same categorical value.</li>\n",
    "<li>The datatype of the variable is incorrect.</li>\n",
    "<li>Some values are set to default values of the variable.</li>\n",
    "<li>There are missing data.</li>\n",
    "<li>There are duplicate data.</li>\n",
    "<li>The formatting of the values is inconsistent.</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "Perform exploratory data analysis comprehensively to gain a good understanding of your dataset. This step should help in formulating the research question of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the notebook, you must fulfill the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>Identify at least 4 exploratory data analysis questions. Properly state the questions in the notebook.</li>\n",
    "<li>Answer the EDA questions using both:</li>\n",
    "<ul><li>Numerical Summaries – measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and correlation</li>\n",
    "<li>Visualization – Appropriate visualization should be used. Each visualization should be accompanied by a brief explanation.</li></ul></ul>\n",
    "To emphasize, both numerical summary and visualization should be presented for each question.\n",
    "The whole process should be supported with verbose textual descriptions of your procedures and\n",
    "findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "Come up with one (1) research question to answer using the dataset. Here are some requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>The research question should arise from the exploratory data analysis. There should be an explanation regarding the connection of the research question to the answers obtained from performing exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "<li>The research question should be within the scope of the dataset.\n",
    "<li>The research question should be answerable by either performing data mining techniques or any domain-specific data modelling technique (i.e., techniques in modelling text, time-series, graph, or image data) taught in class.\n",
    "<li>Make sure to indicate the importance and significance of the research question.</ul></li>"
